The Master script is a concatenation of the three smaller scripts, 

thepoint, editpage, and couponpage

The point works with both thepoint.com/vendors/new and groupon.com/vendors/new

~~~

The salesforce script can be saved as a bookmarklet.  When run on a salesforce deal it creates a data structure for copy/paste into either the master script or the three subscripts.
